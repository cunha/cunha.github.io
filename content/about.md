### Short-bio

Ítalo Cunha is an assistant professor at the Computer Science Department at UFMG, Brazil, since 2012.  He developed his Ph.D. under the French CIFRE Program for cooperation between industry and academia.  He developed his Ph.D. research at Technicolor Research and Innovation, and graduated from Université Pierre et Marie Curie in 2011.  His research focuses on improving network performance, reliability and security.  His contributions provide better visibility of the Internet's topology and interdomain routing; help network operators troubleshoot failures and performance problems; and empower other researchers.  Ítalo has implemented novel network measurement tools like DTrack, built distributed global-scale Internet monitoring systems like Sibyl and [Reverse Traceroute](https://revtr.ccs.neu.edu/), and deployed state-of-the-art research and experimentation platforms like [PEERING](https://peering.ee.columbia.edu/).  He holds a research fellowship from Brazil's National Science and Technology Foundation (CNPq) and serves as a member of the National Brazilian Research and Education Network (RNP) Monitoring Work Group.
