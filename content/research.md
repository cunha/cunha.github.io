## Projects

### PEERING

[PEERING](https://peering.ee.columbia.edu) is a system that enables safe, secure, and tightly controlled access for researchers and educators to the Internet routing system.  Traditionally, the barriers to conduct Internet routing experiments hindered progress.  To experiment with novel routing ideas or to understand aspects of the current routing ecosystem, researchers need the ability to actively participate in this ecosystem by emulating an autonomous system (AS).  The PEERING testbed is the first system to solve this problem once for all qualified researchers.  The testbed can multiplex multiple simultaneous research experiments, each of which independently makes routing decisions and sends and receives traffic.

### Internet Routing

The Internet is a complex system composed of thousands of autonomous networks.  Failures and performance problems often involve myriad causes that are hard to identify.  We research solutions to operational tasks such as network troubleshooting and traffic engineering.  We develop new algorithms, protocols, and mechanisms to measure Internet routes and capture their characteristics in different deployment scenarios.  Challenges we seek to overcome are the lack of visibility over all Internet routes, the impossibility to measure frequently enough to maintain an up-to-date view in face of Internet dynamics, and limited information from transit networks or on-path devices.  We design novel probing techniques, controlled experiments, and inference mechanisms to get an ever-improving understanding of the Internet.

### Network Security

Malicious actors exploit vulnerable systems to perform a range of detrimental activities including phishing, extracting or encrypting sensitive information, hijacking network traffic, performing denial of service attacks or stealing cryptocurrencies.  We research solutions to these problems on multiple fronts, including tracking of email phishing campaigns, identifying the origin of covert Internet denial of service attacks, and helping secure the Internet interdomain routing system.
